We have developed the overall framework of our project. 
GUI or not GUI?! We don't now yet... 
Tiles on the map are 2-D arrays.
One map can be connected to other maps, points on maps could include buildings that players can enter (hence link to another map).
Grasses are also point on the map, on which there is a chance to trigger a fight (again, link to another scenario).
Players have attributes that include a bag, which is a circularly linked list that contains items such as pokeball (to catch pokemon)
And potions (that boosts the stat of the player's Pokemon). 
Likewise, the player's Pokemons are also contained in a circularly linked list. 
NPCs are also present on the map, the player can talk to them or fight them. 
Gym leaders are in buildings and player's ultimate goal is to defeat them.
